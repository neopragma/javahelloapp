# TDD/CI/CD Walkthrough Facilitator's Guide

This project supports part 2 of a 3-part demonstration/walkthrough/dojo exercise.

## 14. Purpose and overview

In [part 1 of the walkthrough](http://github.com/neopragma/javahellolib  "Part 1"), we touched on several activities that occur as part of a software delivery pipeline:

* Using Maven for Java projects
* Separation of concerns
* Using a version control system
* Single branch strategy
* Setting up continuous integration
* Using an IDE
* Packaging a reusable jar to be uploaded to a repository
* Test-driving application code through microtests
* Benefits of frequent commits

In part 2 (this project), we'll address the following aspects:

* Using Spring Boot with Maven 
* Packaging applications for deployment
* Setting up continuous deployment
* Writing a standalone Java application suitable for cloud deployment
* Organizing an automated test suite

Still to come:

* Writing a RESTful microservice in Java suitable for cloud deployment

## 16. Write a driver for a standalone Java application

Let's get busy! 

We're going to develop a standalone Java application that uses the ```javahellolib``` jar we created in part 1 of the walkthrough. If you worked through that part, then you have the jar in the local Maven repository, located at ```~/.m2/repository``` on your development system. We didn't upload it to Maven Central, as it's just a toy project for demonstration, practice, and reference.

### 16.1 The POM

We want to use Spring Boot to help us package the standalone application for deployment. Our POM will be different from the one we used for the ```javhellolib``` project. Here it is:

```xml 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.neopragma.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>hello</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <parent>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
        <version>1.4.2.RELEASE</version>
    </parent>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>    
    
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>   
 
</project>
```

Notice this POM declares a _parent_ POM. It's _spring-boot-starter-parent_, which declares components of Spring Boot that are helpful for creating and packaging applications in a way suited to cloud deployment.





### 11.1. The Main class

Let's risk the ire of purists and just write this one.

```java  
package com.nepragma.springboot;
public class Main {	
	static Hello hello;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		hello = new Hello();
		System.out.println(hello.greet());
		System.exit(0);
	}
}
```

Show them how to run this from inside the IDE. 

### 11.2. Create an executable jar

The way to package a standalone Java application is as an _executable jar_. Let's do that using Maven.

One of the advantages of using Springboot is that it comes with a well-implemented Maven plugin to build executable jars. It works better than the usual ```maven-assembly-plugin``` or ```maven-jar-plugin``` that you may have used in the past.

To include it, add this ```plugin``` declaration to the ```pom.xml``` file:

```shell  
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

You can create the executable jar from the command line like this:

```shell
mvn package
```

You can also build it from within the IDE. Spring Tool Suite comes with several Maven run configurations predefined, but they don't include one for ```mvn package```. Show participants how to create a new run configuration.

![Maven package](images/mvn-package-run-config.png "Maven package")

Note that by using the Springboot Maven plugin, you've made the application compatible with Cloud Foundry. Show participants the project properties in Spring Tool Suite:

![Properties](images/cloud-foundry-standalone.png "Properties")

This doesn't mean we _must_ deploy to Cloud Foundry. It's only a convenience built into Spring Tool Suite to support Cloud Foundry. In fact, we'll be deploying to Heroku later in this exercise (because it's free).

### 11.3. Run the application

Now you can use that run configuration to create the executable jar from within the IDE using the "Run as..." option from the context menu.

To execute the resulting application from the command line, use:

```shell
java -jar hello-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

To execute it from within the IDE, open the context menu and choose Run as... Java application.

### 11.4 Create a .gitignore file

When we imported the project into Spring Tool Suite, some IDE-specific files were created in the project directory that we don't want to store in version control. 

The IDE doesn't show hidden files by default. You can make it do so, but it isn't very intuitive. Show participants how to do this. 

First, locate the nearly-invisible drop-down menu button near the upper right-hand corner of the Package Explorer tab.

![Explorer menu](images/explorer-menu-icon.png "Package Explorer menu")

Choose Filters... to open a dialog where you can control which files appear in Package Explorer. 

![Filters](images/java-element-filters.png "Filters")

Instead of choosing which files to display, you're choosing which files _not_ to display. The entry ```.* resources``` is already checked. Uncheck it to make the IDE show hidden files in Package Explorer.

Show participants how to create a ```.gitignore``` file (or edit the one Springboot generated) to control which files will be committed to version control.

Run a ```git status``` command on the command line to see which files git is watching.

```shell
git status
```

When the author tried this on his laptop, the output from ```git status``` was:

```shell  
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   .DS_Store
	modified:   README.md
	modified:   pom.xml
	deleted:    src/main/java/Hello.java
	deleted:    target/classes/Hello.class
	modified:   target/maven-archiver/pom.properties
	modified:   target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/compile/default-compile/createdFiles.lst
	modified:   target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/compile/default-compile/inputFiles.lst
	modified:   target/maven-status/maven-compiler-plugin/testCompile/default-testCompile/inputFiles.lst
	deleted:    target/myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	modified:   target/surefire-reports/HelloTest.txt
	modified:   target/surefire-reports/TEST-HelloTest.xml
	modified:   target/test-classes/HelloTest.class

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.classpath
	.gitignore
	.project
	.settings/
	images/mvn-package-run-config.png
	src/main/java/com/nepragma/springboot/Main.java
	src/main/java/com/nepragma/springboot/package-info.java
	src/test/java/com/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The ```.DS_Store``` file is created by Mac OSX when you access files. We don't need to keep it in version control. If you're using a different operating system, you won't see that filename in the list.

We don't need anything in the ```target``` directory, as that directory is created as part of the build. We only keep sources and resource files under version control.

The files ```.classpath```, ```.project``` and the directory ```.settings``` are generated and used by Spring Tool Suite (actually, by the underlying Eclipse IDE). They are specific to the local development environment and are not part of the application source code, so we don't keep them under version control.

To prevent these files from being stored in git, we put the following entries in ```.gitignore```:

```shell  
.DS_Store
target
.classpath
.project
.settings
```

If you're using another operating system, you might see temporary files specific to that system that you'll want to include in ```.gitignore``` as well. For example, when you edit a file on Ubuntu Linux using the default text editor, it creates a temporary file with a tilde on the end of its name. Editing a file named ```MyClass.java``` will cause another file to be created, named ```MyClass.java~```. You can use wildcards in the filenames in ```.gitignore``` to prevent those files from being included:

```shell  
*~
```

You _do_ want the ```.gitignore``` file itself to be maintained under version control.

### 11.5 Commit, push, and build

Now commit and push the changes and watch the build run in Travis CI.

## 12. Setting up continuous deployment

Remind participants of the canonical delivery pipeline and/or the diagram showing loops within loops. We're going to extend the pipeline for our tutorial exercise to include automated deployment.

Go to Heroku and define the tutorial app there, using your credentials or setting up new credentials as you please. This will be a _one-off dyno_ app to execute the standalone Java application we just built.

Use the Travis and Heroku command line tools to create an encrypted API key for Heroku, like this:

```shell  
travis encrypt $(heroku auth:token) --add deploy.api_key
```

Edit the ```.travis.yml``` file and add a ```provider``` specification. The file should now look something like this:

```shell
language: java
jdk:
- oraclejdk8
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key:
    secure: [a long encrypted value appears here]
```

Now when you commit and push the modified ```.travis.yml``` file to Github, the build will start on Travis CI and (assuming it worked) the application will be deployed to Heroku.

Because this is a standalone application that runs in a one-off dyno, it will not start automatically and it will not remain operational when you execute it. Show the group how to run such an app on Heroku:

```shell
heroku run bash --app springboot-tutorial
~ $ java -jar target/hello-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Hello, World!
```

## 14. Some notes on application components and project structure

The original sample code for the tutorial combines the "business logic" of saying Hello with code to drive a standalone application and code to build a RESTful microservice. We separated the first two components.

In "real life" the ```hello``` jar file would be uploaded to a Nexus repository where it could be referenced as a _dependency_ in other projects. The repository could be the public Maven Central or a corporate repository behind a firewall, where virus-scanned and approved jars are maintained. 

Rather than clutter a repository with jar files from tutorial exercises, we've left the ```hello``` jar as a source-level dependency within the ```springboot-tutorial``` project. 

We'll create a separate project to build the RESTful service wrapper for the ```hello``` jar. For purposes of the tutorial, we'll just copy the ```hello``` code into that project. Bear in mind this is not the way to do things in "real life."

The tutorial continues in http://github.com/neopragma/hello-service.
